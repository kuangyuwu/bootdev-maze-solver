# Maze Solver

This is the third guided project on [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/).\
The following is excerpted from the [course introduction](https://www.boot.dev/learn/build-maze-solver-python).

> Build a visual interface that draws, solves, and animates a maze in Python. Visualize all the algorithms you've learned.\
> Use Python and Tkinter to build a GUI that solves mazes. You'll be writing code that draws a randomized maze and then systematically solves it. You will use your knowledge of algorithms to automate this fun game! This is a fantastic way to build another real project and solidify your algorithmic skills.
